# Zero reference Method for Low Light Image Enhancement
The zero-DCE (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.06826.pdf) deep learning based model is trained in a newly created dataset.

## About the Project
This project was completed as a course project on `Artificial Intelligence` at `Clarkson University` taught by `Prof. Christopher Lynch`.

### Why Low Light Image Enhancement
- Decrease Noise
- Magnify interpretability or perception of information for human viewers 
- Deepen Surveillance and Security
- Lower Low contrast.
- Challenges in Post processing
- Reduce Color distortion

### Problem Statement : Low Light Image Enhancement
Enhancing visual quality of Image by reducing noise and revealing details in low-light captured images

### What is zero-reference method/Zero-Shot Learning?
Does not require any paired or unpaired data during training. 
Incorporate loss functions to drive the learning of the network.
Recognize classes that the model has not seen during training.
